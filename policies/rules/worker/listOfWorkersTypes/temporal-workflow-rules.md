Worker Code Guidelines + Workflow & Migration Guide



Part A — Worker Code Guidelines

Temporal Workflow Rules
Workflow Rule Zero
A workflow definition must be deterministic. The same history must always produce the same sequence of commands. Any non-deterministic code in a workflow breaks replay and makes the workflow unrecoverable.

What Is Forbidden Inside a Workflow
Any IO — no network calls, no database queries, no file reads or writes.
Non-deterministic functions — no random number generation, no UUID generation, no current time via system clock.
Goroutines or threads spawned outside of the workflow SDK's coroutine model.
Global mutable state.
Direct calls to activity functions — activities must be called via the SDK's activity execution API.
Any SDK or library that is not workflow-safe.

What Is Required Inside a Workflow
Time via workflow.Now() or sdk equivalent — never via system clock.
Random values via workflow.GetRandom() or sdk equivalent — never via math/rand or random module.
All IO delegated to activities via the SDK's activity scheduling API.
All waits expressed via SDK timer, signal channel, or selector — never via sleep.
All concurrent execution via the SDK's goroutine or coroutine model.
Every workflow has a defined timeout at the workflow level and at the activity schedule level.

Signal Handler Rules
Signal handlers must be idempotent — the same signal delivered twice must not change final state.
Signal handlers must complete quickly — no blocking IO inside a signal handler.
Signal names are defined in the workflow interface contract. Changing a signal name is a breaking change.
Signal payloads are typed and documented in contracts/workflows/{name}.yaml.

Query Handler Rules
Query handlers must be side-effect-free — no state mutation inside a query handler.
Query handlers must return immediately — no waiting on signals or timers.
Query names are defined in the workflow interface contract. Changing a query name is a breaking change.

Activity Rules
Activity Rule Zero
Every activity must be idempotent. If an activity is retried after a failure, the second execution must produce the same result or safely detect and skip duplicate work.

Activity Requirements
All IO lives in activities — database queries, HTTP calls, file operations, queue publishes.
Every activity declares its StartToCloseTimeout. No activity runs without a timeout.
Every activity that runs longer than 10 seconds must call heartbeat on a regular interval.
Heartbeat carries the last checkpoint so that the activity can resume from that point on retry.
Activities are retried automatically by the Temporal server. Code must be safe to retry.
Idempotency keys or deduplication IDs are used for all external side effects — payments, emails, external API calls.
Activity errors are classified: non-retryable errors stop the retry loop, retryable errors allow retry.
Every activity wraps its execution in a trace span. The span includes the activity type and workflow ID.

Retry Policy Rules
Every activity has an explicit retry policy — never rely on the Temporal default.
MaxAttempts is always declared. Unbounded retries are forbidden without a compensating mechanism.
BackoffCoefficient and MaxInterval are always declared.
NonRetryableErrorTypes lists every error that should not be retried.
Retry policy is documented in contracts/workflows/{name}.yaml alongside the activity it applies to.


Temporal Worker — Per-Worker Structure
A Temporal worker hosts workflow definitions and activity implementations. Workflows contain only deterministic orchestration logic. Activities contain all IO, side effects, and external calls.

====
Strict Rules — Temporal Worker

realtime/ is called from activities/ only — calling from workflows/ is a hard violation, breaks determinism
Workflow ID and run ID are injected into realtime/sse/client at activity execution time — never read from global state
sse-flow.test must assert workflow ID and run ID are present on every event pushed — missing either fails the test
replay/ tests must pass before any realtime/ change is merged — realtime must never affect workflow replay
Activity attempt number is carried as a span attribute into every SSE event — tested in client.test
connection/manager is the only file that calls sse/client — activities never call client directly
